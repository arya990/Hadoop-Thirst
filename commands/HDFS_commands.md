## credential  

Command to manage credentials, passwords and secrets within credential providers  

COMMAND_OPTION			|	Description  
--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
create alias [-provider provider-path] [-strict] [-value credential-value]	|	Prompts the user for a credential to be stored as the given alias. The hadoop.security.credential.provider.path within the core-site.xml file will be used unless a -provider is indicated. The -strict flag will cause the command to fail if the provider uses a default password. Use -value flag to supply the credential value (a.k.a. the alias password) instead of being prompted.  
delete alias [-provider provider-path] [-strict] [-f]		|	Deletes the credential with the provided alias. The hadoop.security.credential.provider.path within the core-site.xml file will be used unless a -provider is indicated. The -strict flag will cause the command to fail if the provider uses a default password. The command asks for confirmation unless -f is specified  
list [-provider provider-path] [-strict]	|	Lists all of the credential aliases The hadoop.security.credential.provider.path within the core-site.xml file will be used unless a -provider is indicated. The -strict flag will cause the command to fail if the provider uses a default password.  

## distch    
Change the ownership and permissions on many files at once.  

COMMAND_OPTION	|	Description
----------------|---------------------------------
-f		|	List of objects to change  
-i		|	Ignore failures  
-log		|	Directory to log output  

```
hadoop distch /user/arya990/
```  



## hdfs dfs

```sh
- conf <configuration file>     specify an application configuration file
- D <property=value>            use value for given property
- fs <local|namenode:port>      specify a namenode
- jt <local|resourcemanager:port>    specify a ResourceManager
- files <comma separated list of files>    specify comma separated files to be copied to the map reduce cluster
- libjars <comma separated list of jars>    specify comma separated jar files to include in the classpath.
- archives <comma separated list of archives>    specify comma separated archives to be unarchived on the compute ma
chines.
```

## getconf
- namenodes	gets list of namenodes in the cluster.
- secondaryNameNodes	gets list of secondary namenodes in the cluster.
- backupNodes	gets list of backup nodes in the cluster.
- includeFile	gets the include file path that defines the datanodes that can join the cluster.
- excludeFile	gets the exclude file path that defines the datanodes that need to decommissioned.
- nnRpcAddresses	gets the namenode rpc addresses
- confKey	gets a specific key from the configuration


```sh
hdfs getconf -namenodes
```

```sh
datanode.c.spatial-rookery-140916.internal
```

```sh
hdfs getconf -nnRpcAddresses
```
```sh
datanode.c.spatial-rookery-140916.internal:8022
```

## envvars

```sh
hdfs envvars
```

   * display computed Hadoop environment variables.

## groups

Returns the group information given one or more usernames

```
hdfs groups
```

```sh
hdfs : hdfs hadoop
```

## secondarynamenode

-checkpoint [force]	Checkpoints the SecondaryNameNode if EditLog size >= fs.checkpoint.size. If force is used, checkpoint irrespective of EditLog size

-format	Format the local storage during startup.

-geteditsize	Prints the number of uncheckpointed transactions on the NameNode.

```sh
hdfs secondarynamenode -checkpoint
```

## hdfs namenode

- backup	Start backup node.

- checkpoint	Start checkpoint node.

- format [-clusterid cid] [-force] [-nonInteractive]	Formats the specified NameNode. It starts the NameNode, formats it and then shut it down. -force option formats if the name directory exists. -nonInteractive option aborts if the name directory exists, unless -force option is specified.

- upgrade [-clusterid cid] [-renameReserved <k-v pairs>]	Namenode should be started with upgrade option after the distribution of new Hadoop version.

- upgradeOnly [-clusterid cid] [-renameReserved <k-v pairs>]	Upgrade the specified NameNode and then shutdown it.

- rollback	Rollback the NameNode to the previous version. This should be used after stopping the cluster and distributing the old Hadoop version.

- rollingUpgrade <rollback|started>	See Rolling Upgrade document for the detail.

- importCheckpoint	Loads image from a checkpoint directory and save it into the current one. Checkpoint dir is read from property dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir

- initializeSharedEdits	Format a new shared edits dir and copy in enough edit log segments so that the standby NameNode can start up.

- bootstrapStandby [-force] [-nonInteractive] [-skipSharedEditsCheck]	Allows the standby NameNodeâ€™s storage directories to be bootstrapped by copying the latest namespace snapshot from the active NameNode. This is used when first configuring an HA cluster. The option -force or -nonInteractive has the same meaning as that described in namenode -format command. -skipSharedEditsCheck option skips edits check which ensures that we have enough edits already in the shared directory to start up from the last checkpoint on the active.

- recover [-force]	Recover lost metadata on a corrupt filesystem. See HDFS User Guide for the detail.

- metadataVersion	Verify that configured directories exist, then print the metadata versions of the software and the image.
